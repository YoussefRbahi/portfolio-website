        I began my programming journey at age 10, teaching myself Visual Basic
        to create my own 3D MMORPG. While that ambition was a bit out of reach,
        it ignited a lasting passion for programming and led me to experiment
        with web development using Dreamweaver,{" "}
        <span className="highlighted-text">HTML</span>, and{" "}
        <span className="highlighted-text">CSS</span>. These early explorations
        were purely for fun, and I hadn&apos;t yet considered a professional
        career in tech.

        During high school, I expanded my technical skills by building a few
        Arduino projects and dabbling in{" "}
        <span className="highlighted-text">Python</span>, further fueling my
        interest in technology. After earning my Bachelor&apos;s degree, I
        ventured into{" "}
        <span className="highlighted-text">digital marketing</span> and
        completed an MBA, thoroughly enjoying the blend of creativity and
        strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        My role in marketing unexpectedly brought me back to my tech roots, as I
        often found myself tasked with updating and managing{" "}
        <span className="highlighted-text">WordPress</span> websites. This work
        reignited my interest in web development, especially in designing
        websites that are visually appealing and functionally robust.
      </p>
      <p>
        Motivated by this renewed passion, I delved into{" "}
        <span className="highlighted-text">JavaScript</span> and expanded my
        expertise to include modern technologies like{" "}
        <span className="highlighted-text">React</span>,{" "}
        <span className="highlighted-text">Vue</span>,{" "}
        <span className="highlighted-text">Tailwind</span>, and{" "}
        <span className="highlighted-text">Node</span>. I am also pursuing an{" "}
        <span className="highlighted-text">MSc in Computer Science</span>,
        building a strong foundation in <span>software engineering</span>{" "}
        concepts. My background in marketing, particularly in{" "}
        <span className="highlighted-text">SEO</span> and{" "}
        <span className="highlighted-text">UI/UX</span>, allows me to build
        websites that are not only functional but also strategically effective.
